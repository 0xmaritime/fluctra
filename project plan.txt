# Decentralized Token Discount Platform: Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

An AI-powered, SvelteKit-based platform that enables crypto token creators to easily set up and manage strategic token discount sales without coding knowledge. The platform will support Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Base, providing a performance-optimized interface for creating discount pools while taking a small percentage fee from transactions. By positioning between token creation and DEXs, we capture value in the existing liquidity flow between PumpFun, DEXScreener, and trading bots.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Technical Setup
- Set up SvelteKit project with TypeScript and testing framework (prioritizing performance)
- Implement wallet connection for multiple chains (Ethereum and Base first)
- Create core UI components and design system with performance optimization
- Set up deployment pipeline on Vercel or similar platform
- Implement basic AI infrastructure for discount optimization

### Smart Contract Development
- Develop and audit basic discount sale smart contract for Ethereum
- Create contract interaction layer in JavaScript
- Test contract functionality with sample tokens
- Implement transaction monitoring system

### Core User Flows
- Token creator registration/authentication via wallet signature
- AI-assisted discount pool creation with suggested rates based on market conditions
- Discovery page with DEXScreener-like functionality plus direct purchase options
- Transaction handling for token purchases with trading bot API endpoints
- Integration points with existing liquidity flow ecosystem

### Deliverable
A functional MVP supporting Ethereum that allows creating and participating in basic discount sales with a clean, simple interface.
